# Rails from (Docker) scratch

Create a dockerised rails application development environment without
installing ruby or rails locally.

The advantage of this is to enable rails application development without
requiring the developer to mess about with ruby version managers.

The final development environment uses the process described in [this
article](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/ruby-on-whales-docker-for-ruby-rails-development).
